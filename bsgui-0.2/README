Bad Sector's OpenGL GUI Readme
==============================

This is a small GUI library for OpenGL i wrote. It is written in C++, mostly for
my personal usage. However, i decided to release the code in the public,
licensed under the terms of the MIT license (read LICENSE) for others to use it
if they want.

But note: the library is hardly documented and the interface may change. I
	consider it to be in "alpha" stage, not production stable and of course
	it contains lots of bugs which may or may not get fixed. You have been
	warned. If you still want to use this lib, then you're welcome to do so.
	

1. Building the library
-----------------------

	Except if you build the library using Dev-C++ for Microsoft Windows or
	you write manually the Makefile, then you will need a small tool i
	wrote, called 'bmake'. You can find this tool at:
	
		http://www.slashstone.com/more/bmake
		
	The rest of this section assumes that you have downloaded and installed
	bmake version 0.3 (or any newer that may exist at the location above).

	a) Building under *nix-like systems using bmake
	-----------------------------------------------
	First of all be warned that i only tested that with Fedora Core 3 Linux
	and in Ubuntu Linux AMD64 edition. The rest is untested.
	
	Just type:
		bmake
		
	and wait (it won't take much time).
	
	b) Building under Win32 using bmake
	-----------------------------------
	I haven't tested that, but it should work.
	
	Just type:
		bmake

	c) Building under Win32 using the supplied Dev-C++ project file
	---------------------------------------------------------------
		Not supported anymore
		
	d) Building with GNU make under Linux
	-------------------------------------
		(may not work... this is only for Linux)
	To build the library type:
	
		make -f Makefile.lib
		
	To build the demo type:
	
		make -f Makefile.bm
	
	e) Building manually
	--------------------
	Using a text editor, open the bsgui.prj file and look for list of .cpp
	and for the list of .h files.

	Using whatever method you prefer, add these files to your project and
	build it.


2. Installing BSGUI
-------------------
	There is not much about installing it. If you made a static library,
copy the libbsgui.a in your /usr/local/lib (under Linux) or c:\dev-cpp\lib
(under Windows/Dev-C++) or c:\mingw\lib (under Windows/plain MinGW) or wherever
your libraries reside and the contents of "include" in your /usr/local/include
(under Linux) or c:\dev-cpp\include (under Windows/Dev-C++) or c:\mingw\include
(under Windows/plain MinGW) or wherever your include files reside. Then you'll
be ok.

3. Using BSGUI
--------------
	Look the demo/demo.cpp file. It uses almost every control (widget) that
BSGUI has. For a quick-startup tutorial, look docs/tutorial.html (note: this
tutorial is about BSGUI 0.1 - some things are a bit different in BSGUI 0.2... i
will try to update it as soon as possible and write some documentation for
BSGUI)
